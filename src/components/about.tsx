          My name is Diego, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm deeply passionate 
          about technology and driven by a curiosity to constantly learn new things. 
          One of my key objectives is to have a positive impact and contribute to improving people's lives
          by applying the knowledge and skills I've developed. My problem-solving skills have been honed through coursework and real-world applications,
          where I tackle complex challenges and optimize solutions. I am also highly adaptable, having collaborated with teams on various projects.
          I continue learning and developing my skills so that, when the time comes, I will be ready to demonstrate what I am capable of.
